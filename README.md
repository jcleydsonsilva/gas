#Automated Genome Annotation System

This repository contains an automated genome annotation system, written in Perl, that utilizes MySQL as the database to store the data and is executed on an Apache web server.

#Overview

The objective of this project is to provide an efficient and accurate solution for genome annotation, enabling the identification of genetic elements such as genes, promoter regions, coding regions, and other relevant features.

The system was developed using the Perl programming language, widely used in biological data analysis and processing. Additionally, MySQL was chosen as the database to store the necessary information for annotation.

#Key Features

Automated annotation of DNA sequences.

Identification of protein-coding regions.

Detection of promoter regions and other regulatory elements.

Efficient storage of annotated results in the MySQL database.

Web interface for querying and visualizing annotated results.

#Environment Setup

To run the system in your local environment, follow the steps below:

Ensure that Perl and MySQL are installed on your system.

Configure an Apache web server to execute the system.

Import the provided database using the database.sql file.

Update the database connection settings in the config.pl file.

Place the system files in the web server's directory.

#Usage
After setting up the environment, you can access the system through your web browser by entering the web server's address.

On the home page, you can upload a DNA sequence file to be annotated.

Upon upload, the system will process the sequence and perform annotation.

The results will be stored in the database and can be queried through the web interface.
